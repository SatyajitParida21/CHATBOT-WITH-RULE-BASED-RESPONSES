Rule-Based Chatbot ðŸ¤– | Task #1
I created a rule-based chatbot developed as part of Task #1 during my internship at CodSoft. The chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using pattern matching and if-else statements. It provides responses to greetings, general queries, and common phrases, offering a structured conversation flow.

Features:
Uses regular expressions for pattern matching.
Supports common user queries like greetings, AI-related questions, and general knowledge.
Developed using Python .
Can be integrated into web applications or extended with more responses its like a  brain of web applications.

How It Works:
The chatbot listens for user input.
It matches the input with predefined rules using regex.
If a match is found, it returns an appropriate response.
If no match is found, it prompts the user to rephrase their question.

Future Improvements:
Expand the response database for better interactions.
Implement NLP-based responses for more flexibility.
Develop a UI for a better user experience.
This project provided a great learning experience in Natural Language Processing and chatbot development. ðŸš€
